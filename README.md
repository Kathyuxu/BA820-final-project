Merge data: this notebook is for merging datasets from all 8 cities and finally generalize the California dataset as the raw data.  
Part1: This notebook is for EDA, Data Preprocessing, Normalization, Hierarchical Clustering and K-Means Clustering with PCA and UMAP.  
Part2: This notebook is designed for K-Prototype Clustering with UMAP to enhance computational efficiency. To maintain data consistency, the EDA, Data Preprocessing, and Normalization steps from Part 1 have been retained.
